Her father, a full-blooded elf, taught her to master the art of archery from a young age, while her mother, a human, instilled in her a deep love for nature and the creatures that inhabit it. As she grew older, Lyn developed a strong bond with her animal companion, a white wolf named Snow, whom she rescued as a cub. Together, they roam the forests and protect the innocent from all kinds of danger. Lyn's quest to rid the land of evil has taken her to many far-off lands, and her reputation as a fearsome ranger precedes her. Despite her stoic exterior, Lyn cares deeply for the people and creatures she encounters on her travels, and will stop at nothing to protect them from harm."
